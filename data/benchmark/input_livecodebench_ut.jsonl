Some of the levels in the game are impossible to clear while others can always be cleared. In particular, if possible[i] == 0, then the i^th level is impossible to clear for both the players. A player gains 1 point on clearing a level and loses 1 point if the player fails to clear it.\nAt the start of the game, Alice will play some levels in the given order starting from the 0^th level, after which Bob will play for the rest of the levels.\nAlice wants to know the minimum number of levels she should play to gain more points than Bob, if both players play optimally to maximize their points.\nReturn the minimum number of levels Alice should play to gain more points.

For worker i:\n\nTo decrease the mountain's height by x, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 + ... + workerTimes[i] * x seconds. For example:\n\n\t\nTo reduce the height of the mountain by 1, it takes workerTimes[i] seconds.\nTo reduce the height of the mountain by 2, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 seconds, and so on.\n\n\n\nReturn an integer representing the minimum number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain 0.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: mountainHeight = 4, workerTimes = [2,1,1]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nOne way the height of the mountain can be reduced to 0 is:\n\nWorker 0 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[0] = 2 seconds.\nWorker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 = 3 seconds.\nWorker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[2] = 1 second.\n\nSince they work simultaneously, the minimum time needed is max(2, 3, 1) = 3 seconds.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: mountainHeight = 10, workerTimes = [3,2,2,4]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation:\n\nWorker 0 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 = 9 seconds.\nWorker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12 seconds.\nWorker 2 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[2] + workerTimes[2] * 2 + workerTimes[2] * 3 = 12 seconds.\nWorker 3 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[3] + workerTimes[3] * 2 = 12 seconds.\n\nThe number of seconds needed is max(9, 12, 12, 12) = 12 seconds.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: mountainHeight = 5, workerTimes = [1]\nOutput: 15\nExplanation:\nThere is only one worker in this example, so the answer is workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 + workerTimes[0] * 3 + workerTimes[0] * 4 + workerTimes[0] * 5 = 15.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= mountainHeight <= 10^5\n1 <= workerTimes.length <= 10^4\n1 <= workerTimes[i] <= 10^6\n\nFormat: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem:\ndef minNumberOfSeconds(mountainHeight: int, workerTimes: List[int]) -> int:\n\n### code solution\ndef minNumberOfSeconds(mountainHeight: int, workerTimes: List[int]) -> int:\n    min_time = float('inf')\n    for i in range(mountainHeight + 1):\n        time = 0\n        for time_required in [sum(range(i+1)) * workerTime for workerTime in workerTimes]:\n            time = max(time, time_required)\n        min_time = min(min_time, time)\n    return min_time\n\nPlease add detailed comments to the test cases you write.
