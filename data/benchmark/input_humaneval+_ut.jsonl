Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line. n cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. The two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. All cars move in the same speed. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. This function outputs the number of such collisions.\n \n\n### code solution\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving left to right and right to left respectively.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The number of cars in each set.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The number of collisions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the number of collisions to 0\n    collisions = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the total number of cars\n    total_cars = 2 * n\n    \n    # Initialize the current number of left-moving cars that have not collided\n    left_cars = n\n    \n    # Initialize the current number of right-moving cars that have not collided\n    right_cars = n\n    \n    # While there are still cars left\n    while left_cars > 0 and right_cars > 0:\n        # Calculate the number of cars that will collide in this step\n        collisions += min(left_cars, right_cars)\n        \n        # Decrement the number of left-moving cars that have not collided\n        left_cars -= min(left_cars, right_cars)\n        \n        # Decrement the number of right-moving cars that have not collided\n        right_cars -= min(left_cars, right_cars)\n    \n    # Return the total number of collisions\n    return collisions\n\nPlease add detailed comments to the test cases you write.
